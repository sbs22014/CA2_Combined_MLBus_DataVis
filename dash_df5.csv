"They are right to criticize this. Average inflation across the Irish economy over the past year has been 6.3% (https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/inflation-in-ireland-rises-to-6-3-new-figures-show-1523937.html , this article discusses it, the numbers are coming from CSO) 

The current disability allowance is €220 / week. This budget sees an increase of €12 to €232 / week, which is only an increase of about ~5%. So in a lot of ways, this means a net decrease in your purchasing power as a recipient of the Disability Allowance. 
While this is the same across all social benefit payments, one could argue that people on Disability Allowance are unfairly penalized here because they will rely on this payment long term as opposed to something like job-seekers benefit which is designed to be a short term support. 

This, in addition to the government discussing an overhaul to the Disability Allowance system recently, it kinda seems like this government has a real want to see these payments reduced or removed? Which doesn't seem like a worthwhile use of time when such a small percentage of people are on Disability and also when employment is so high.

That said the inflation example is a poor one. Most people are worse off relative to inflation. That also applies to those who are in the workforce. Most people’s wages haven’t risen by 6.3%. Wages have risen an average of 4.3%, so less than the increase to disability allowance.
