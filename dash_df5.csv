It is difficult to understand how the cost of disability payment, acknowledged and introduced for the first time in Budget 2023 at ‚Ç¨500, has not been continued. Minister McGrath said last year 'it is important that we acknowledge that persons living with a disability face additional costs.' These costs were acknowledged in the Indecon Report, and the recent Green Paper, at ‚Ç¨8,700 to ‚Ç¨12,300 per year and yet there are no such cost of disability measures in Budget 2024.

>Along with other anti-poverty organisations we had called for a ‚Ç¨27.50 increase in core social protection rates to keep up with inflation and prevent a rise in inequality and poverty.

"They are right to criticize this. Average inflation across the Irish economy over the past year has been 6.3% (https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/inflation-in-ireland-rises-to-6-3-new-figures-show-1523937.html , this article discusses it, the numbers are coming from CSO) 

The current disability allowance is ‚Ç¨220 / week. This budget sees an increase of ‚Ç¨12 to ‚Ç¨232 / week, which is only an increase of about ~5%. So in a lot of ways, this means a net decrease in your purchasing power as a recipient of the Disability Allowance. 
While this is the same across all social benefit payments, one could argue that people on Disability Allowance are unfairly penalized here because they will rely on this payment long term as opposed to something like job-seekers benefit which is designed to be a short term support. 

This, in addition to the government discussing an overhaul to the Disability Allowance system recently, it kinda seems like this government has a real want to see these payments reduced or removed? Which doesn't seem like a worthwhile use of time when such a small percentage of people are on Disability and also when employment is so high.
