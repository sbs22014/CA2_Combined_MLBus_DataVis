Yes they've followed the UK in setting up a Low Pay Commission who recommend a level to make the minimum wage two-thirds of median full time salary.

It's great but it does put a strain on small independent shops who might already be tight on budget and need staff. I feel like there should be a difference between a small indo buisness and a massive company when it comes to minimum wage because it really does hurt the small shops if you're paying say 4 employees at full time and all of a sudden you're needing to pay them an extra 2 grand each. Lot of places run small margins.,2023-10-10 15:21:45,-8,75,15,21
Just because your a small independent shop does not mean you have a right to exist. If the margins are to thin or you are not able to pay people a workable wage then maybe you should re-examine your business,2023-10-10 17:01:55,11,76,17,1
"Inflation and cost of living hits buisness owners too. Lots of people are rightfully angry when local businesses go broke because of things like Council Rates or rent (Galway was hit very hard and lost a good few little places) but it seems nobody actually wants to help them. 

I agree with the raising of the minimum wage but I don't like that small independent buisiness is taking a big brunt without much help for them. Fuck load of places, even ones you would think make huge amounts of money run small enough margins and they will be swallowed up or forced to close and then /r/Ireland will have a big thread where people are sad and devestated that so and so has closed down or that so many small independent shops have closed down and be angry that the government/council etc. didn't help them or that people don't support their local shops etc. This is a big jump in minimum wage and when you have a few employees working full time it adds up and it all happens at once as well.  I feel that something needs to be put in place to help them.",2023-10-10 17:44:29,0,77,17,44

"[Disability Federation of Ireland are reeeeeally not happy](https://www.disability-federation.ie/news/press-releases/2023/10/10/devastating-sidelining-ofdisabled-people-in-budget/):

>Responding to Budget 2024, the Disability Federation of Ireland (DFI), has said it is devastating to see the sidelining of disability and the tokenistic attitude to disabled people in Budget 2024.  
>  
>The measures introduced today do not come close to meeting the needs of people with disabilities. It is difficult to understand how the cost of disability payment, acknowledged and introduced for the first time in Budget 2023 at €500, has not been continued. Minister McGrath said last year 'it is important that we acknowledge that persons living with a disability face additional costs.' These costs were acknowledged in the Indecon Report, and the recent Green Paper, at €8,700 to €12,300 per year and yet there are no such cost of disability measures in Budget 2024.   
>  
>Along with other anti-poverty organisations we had called for a €27.50 increase in core social protection rates to keep up with inflation and prevent a rise in inequality and poverty. Although the Minister referenced inflation, the increase announced today falls significantly short at €12.",2023-10-10 15:19:35,19,159,15,19
"They are right to criticize this. Average inflation across the Irish economy over the past year has been 6.3% (https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/inflation-in-ireland-rises-to-6-3-new-figures-show-1523937.html , this article discusses it, the numbers are coming from CSO) 

The current disability allowance is €220 / week. This budget sees an increase of €12 to €232 / week, which is only an increase of about ~5%. So in a lot of ways, this means a net decrease in your purchasing power as a recipient of the Disability Allowance. 
While this is the same across all social benefit payments, one could argue that people on Disability Allowance are unfairly penalized here because they will rely on this payment long term as opposed to something like job-seekers benefit which is designed to be a short term support. 

This, in addition to the government discussing an overhaul to the Disability Allowance system recently, it kinda seems like this government has a real want to see these payments reduced or removed? Which doesn't seem like a worthwhile use of time when such a small percentage of people are on Disability and also when employment is so high.

In any case, I might have been off here in my calculations, this is just some quick maths I did now, I might be misinterpreting this information but if I'm correct, it does seem like the Disability Federation has every right to be pissed off.",2023-10-10 18:10:16,9,160,18,10
"Those with disabilities definitely need more supports.

That said the inflation example is a poor one. Most people are worse off relative to inflation. That also applies to those who are in the workforce. Most people’s wages haven’t risen by 6.3%. Wages have risen an average of 4.3%, so less than the increase to disability allowance.

I suspect they’ve held off until they’ve restructured disability benefits. See who feels most aggrieved when that has concluded and then try and throw some money at it to fix it",2023-10-11 02:58:23,2,161,2,58

"Again the budget is quick little grabs of ""goodies"" and minimal tax ""cuts"" advertised with little impact on the actual issues plaguing the country. They can't keep getting away with this and their annual increase in taxing  cigarettes since 2000's, as if that's the answer to grow the economy. 

The landlord relief is a total joke but they clearly want to appease their mates/themselves who were probably pissed from not getting any of the pie last year. €160m tax break for landlords and €88m for renters? 

The public transport that I saw was basically just a reduction of 20c to bus fares. What about, I dunno, actual infrastructure development? EDIT: More added but same stuff they've been banging on about with no action for years, I.e. Metrolink

The health budget is bunged up. The lack of any form of substantial equity into affordable housing and again continuing with these schemes...

The crime increases are a joke? 800 new gardai next year? What's that going to actually do to address the cause of the rise in antisocial behaviour?

I'll take the rent credit but the -0.5% decrease in USC when it was promised to be abolished by the same crowd 7 years ago just sums up their entire run. Too little, too late.
